Q: We’re officially one month in. How are you feeling?

A: So far so good. I'm really wanting to get closer to meeting employers but that will come in time.

Q: How has your relationship to your peers matched or contrasted with your expectations? Do you think that will change at all during the remaining five months?

A: The relationships are cool. Naturally you get to know people more during pairing. I definitely like the fact that we pair in the sense that it exposes us to different people's skill sets and styles.

Q: Monday we’ll conduct our first individual skills evaluation. How do you think it’ll go? What will be your strengths and weaknesses?

A: Who knows. I feel like I'm doing well but can always do better.

Q: Make a "resolution" for the next month – what are you going to focus on doing better?

A: I'm going to try and be a more communicative pair.

Q: Is working in a web context more exciting than our command-line applications?

A: Totally. SHIT IS LIVE!!!! Plus that's the monemaker.

Q: How could things be simplified? AKA, do any of the components/technologies seem unnecessarily complicated?

A: Fuck postgres installation on Mac OS. Also, sequel is shit. I get why we are doing it, but it's wonky, ill-named, and the documentation on it sucks. Probably because all the cool people don't use it.

Q: What practices/techniques are benefitting you so far? Which feel like they’re slowing you down?

A: Testing is really helping. Pairing, while good, is slowing me down personally.
