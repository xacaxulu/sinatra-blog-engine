Q: Another project in the books. How did you feel about your contribution to your team’s project?

A: I feel fine about it. I know I did a good job on pulling my weight.

Q. What did you think of Sinatra? Sequel? Would you enjoy using these tools on a larger project? Did you think their APIs were logical and reasonable, or are there changes you’d like to see?

A: Sinatra was great! I will definitely use it again, it's much lighter than Rails and easier to debug. I actually really enjoyed it. Sequel, go fuck yourself. Your name sucks, your API sucks, you suck. I will never use Sequel again.


Q: Now that you really understand the problem, what would you do differently if you could go back to the beginning? Were the parts you thought would be hard actually hard? What about the parts you thought would be easy?

A: I actually think we approached it correctly. We had a controller, views and models and we really didn't couple them unecessarily. The improvements we could have made were simply limited by time, like refactoring. Luckily we had great test coverage at > 95%.

Q: Are you feeling relatively comfortable with databases or is it, to paraphrase the amazing Bill O’Reilly, "data goes in, data goes out, you can’t explain that!"

A: I feel better than before I started. I've used ActiveRecord quite a bit and I'm fine with DB stuff. Just knowing how to write raw sql is good too.

Q: It seems that formalized project management among project groups has been pretty lax. Do you think that’ll continue? Why/why not?

A: I think it will continue. Our project sizes don't require serious PM. Pivotal Tracker is great, but in the end, it's unecessary. Pen and paper is fine. I feel like doing Pivotal Tracker is an exercise just for the sake of doing it. Writing good tests is all the Project Management I need right now. I don't need extra homework so I can say I use PT.

Q: We need to start contributing to open source projects. Do you have your eye on any projects that need a little help?

A: No I don't but I'll probably work on some tiny patch for Metasploit since it's in Ruby now.
