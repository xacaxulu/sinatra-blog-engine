Q: What was the most surprising thing about your work on the project?

A: I quickly came to the realization that I had to think a lot more about memory and data handling techniques. I haven't really been in the position where structural/architectural changes were necessary
for a program to run (substantially) more efficiently. I think this became apparent during our testing phase which was completed entirely in MiniTest.

Q: Focusing on the pair work process, what did your pair do well? What did you struggle with?

A: My partner was the most awesome [Paul Blackwell](https://twitter.com/pnblackwell) and he really called me on bs code pretty regularly. He was like my rubber-ducky but with weapons. Paul would force me to verbalize what I was trying to do and in the process, we would figure out if the structure we were designing made sense. Definitely an active pair. I struggled with delegating tasks out. Because we are newish to the pair scheme, I think this is ok for now (i.e. we did almost everything on a 70" flatscreen), I would like to get to a comfort level with my pair where I can write a bunch of tests, then have the pair make them pass and the other way around.

Q: Whatâ€™s your favorite thing about our class (people and/or structures)?
A: Franklin Webber. That is all. And also I really like that there is a HEALTHY level of competition among the more experienced developers, but not to the extent that it kills our super awesome style of 'everyone helps everyone if they ask for help'. I like that we are really out there for each other and aren't (yet) cut-throat.
