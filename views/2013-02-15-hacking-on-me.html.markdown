Hacking on me

Q: What’s a technique that you’ve used in the SalesEngine project that was once totally opaque but now is clear?

A: TESTING! I've used tests a bit in the past, mostly RSpec, but with MiniTest, I really have been able to get into
a red->green->refactor model. I'm sure the repetetive nature of the project was by design so that we can test frequently. I see the benefit of testing mostly as a tool to help define and solidify the idea of what a program should do. In a few instances, I wasn't sure how to write a method, but after defining a failing test, it came together in my brain-grapes.

Q: Is working in a pair harder or easier than being by yourself?

A: It's harder in the sense that I have to monitor the speed at which I develop. I definitely have to be conscious of my partner's skills and abilities and make sure that he/she totally understands what's going on. It's EASIER in the sense that the code that has come out of it has been much better in terms of quality and has been much more readable.

Q: It’s been a long three weeks. Do you feel like a developer yet?

A: Yes. Being a developer is a state of mind as much as it is having a collection of skills. We are definitely doing the DEVolution here and while we are inexperienced devs, we are devs nonetheless.

Q: You have 21 weeks to go. What are you most excited about?

A: Getting to the point where we can meet with future employers and really start negotiating salaries/work reqs etc.

Q: How has the class environment matched or differed from your expectations?

A: I thought there would be more explosions and fights.

Q: What resources are you relying on when you need support, and why?

A: My brother Lake Denman. He is a great developer and usually addresses the harder questions in Ruby for me. He is an awesome
dude and is coming out to visit the gSchool team in a few weeks.
