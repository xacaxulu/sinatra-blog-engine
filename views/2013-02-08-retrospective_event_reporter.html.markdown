The EventReporter attempted to parse a CSV file and present data sets given a certain combination of attributes and criteria. Print and Save abilities
were part of the program.

    * I used a normal workday with pomodoros as my pattern. 
    I did experience some success with early-morning coding.

    * https://github.com/jdendroid/event_reporter.git
  
    * The code works! That's great. The internals could use a lot of optimization. 
    I'm sure that I'm iterating too much.

    * Storyboarding and pseudo-coding helped me understand the pattern. 
    I'll use that again.

    * Going down rabbit-holes for too long without asking for help. 
    A 10 minute pairing session solved problems that I had wasted hours on.
