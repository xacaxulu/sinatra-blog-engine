Q: What technique from the book have you meant to be doing, but arenâ€™t doing regularly/effectively? Why not? Can you change?

A: The section on managing perceptions was pretty interesting for me. I give exactly 0 fucks about what most people think but I suppose I should care more, especially as it pertains to my work. I'm that I should make an effort to showcase my particular skill sets instead of just hoping that the right person/company will snatch me up on their own. I fucking hate 'sales' and anything to do with that so selling myself seems like some sort of prostitution. My usual sales pitch is 'If this looks like a match, let's do it, if not, whatever, go to hell." I need to be a little more cognizant of the professional demeanor that I present to people. I should shower too.
