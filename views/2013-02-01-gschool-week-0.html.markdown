Week 1

Week 1 was easy. I got moved into my apartment and met the other gSchool team members. Jeff and Frank were great and helped me get set up
right away. We started into things pretty quickly and went to work on a microblogger application.

Some of the things I'm really glad are included in this course are:

    * Frequent pairing

    * Real-world applications
  
    * Inclusion of javascript/html5/css into the course.

Regarding the reading of Passionate Programmer:

SERIAL OPPORTUNIST- one of the stories covered this concept. Makes a great deal of sense. I guess we are all heading down that path.


If SaaS is hot now that goes against the dudes point in the book. It's better to be an outlier and try and position yourself ahead of the curve as that's where the big leaps will take place.


What comes after RoR or say 2 steps out in terms of programming/development. 

What will consumers need?
How can you get ahead of the curve on merging security and daily life.


I understand the short term gains but 100k for 5yrs doesn't equal 80k for 2 then a million in equity, which you could keep or sell.
The more I dig into this shit I realize it isn't about being a wage earner. It's about positioning yourself on the cusp of something fucking big. There will always be someone who can code better than you, but who can code AND run a business AND stay hot on the trend wave etc...

Again, much of this shit is highly predictable in a supply/demand model but that model doesn't account for two main variables.
1. the speed at which technology advances.
2. the basics of human psychology as it pertains to technology.

Most of the models used are extremely outdated, just slight buildouts on previous gens of whatever the fuck it is.

Innovation is where it is at, not some snails pace, I am talking leaps that better resemble the tech curve which isn't a standard curve at all.

The reason it seems standardized is because everyone quantifies shit in dollars or euros. The capitalism of the 90's is old and dysfunctional which results in the interaction between it and technology being extremely awkward. Like first blind date awkward. Someone is drinking hard.

Think about how many people view programming as "OH WOW, look at the money." That is a really primitive approach. We are conditioned to deal in dollars hence why it doesn't make sense. If you look at innovation or the actual tech advancements as a standalone currency your entire world view will become more functional.

Like the dude pointed out in the book about taking higher paying jobs and just being more miserable. He saw the light and experienced the difference. Many people fail to do so. 

Think about when dude put this book out (2009). The concepts are sound but even some of the languages he is discussing are out of date to me and I don't even fuck with this shit. I have as much knowledge about it as I do about what type of cookware is better than the rest.

Anyway. Being outside the forest allows me to look in and take a much more macro view, especially since I don't have any idea of who the players are etc...

I believe the point was made that the key is providing solutions for real world problems. Real life shit. A bunch of pointless code that doesn't help a company generate profit or retain or expand their customer base is just fucking code.
